/*
 This addon uses a countdown to shutdown your computer.

 If the user running the application is not an  admin you will receive this message:
 
 "[USER]is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."
 
 To fix it, log in as admin and run in terminal the following:
 
 sudo nano  /private/etc/sudoers
 
 then enter a new line:

 [the username you want to give access] ALL=(ALL) ALL
 
 Example:
 myUser ALL=(ALL) ALL
 
 Then close nano saving changes:
 crtl+x [enter]
 y [enter]
 
 then use:
 shutdown();
